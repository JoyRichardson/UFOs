# UFO Sightings
## Overview
Dana is a Data Journalist who wants to write about McMinnville, Oregon, which is famous for UFO sightings and has an annual gathering celebrating such. McMinnville is her hometown and this opportunity allows her to revisit memories as well as to focus on a topic she has been interested in since she was a child - UFO sightings.  
## Purpose
Dana only has a Javascript file filled with sighting information in many countries, cities, and states.  She wants to create a HTML page that includes her article, a table with filters which allows searching and displaying the sightings information. She knows that she can use Javascript to manipulate the data so readers can easily use her website.  
## Resources
Software(s): HTML, CSS, Chrome Developer Tools, Bootstrap 3.3.3, and Visual Studio Code 1.57.1
## Results
Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
